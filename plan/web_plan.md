# Web Blog Project Planning Commands

Here's a structured command sequence using your SuperClaude framework for comprehensive project planning:

## **Stage 1: Strategic Analysis & Vision**

```
/analyze @. --scope project --focus architecture --persona-architect --think-hard
"Analyze requirements for a modern web blog project focusing on: learning objectives, tech stack evaluation, scalability considerations, and development phases"
```

## **Stage 2: Technical Architecture Design**

```
/design --persona-architect --wave-mode auto --c7 --seq
"Design comprehensive technical architecture for web blog including: frontend framework selection, backend API strategy, database design, authentication system, content management approach, and deployment pipeline"
```

## **Stage 3: Development Planning & Estimation**

```
/estimate --persona-architect --think --seq
"Create detailed development timeline with: feature breakdown, complexity scoring, dependency mapping, milestone definitions, and realistic time estimates for each development phase"
```

## **Stage 4: Tech Stack Specification**

```
/implement --type specification --persona-backend --persona-frontend --c7 --validate
"Specify complete tech stack including: frontend framework and libraries, backend technologies, database selection, hosting infrastructure, development tools, testing frameworks, and deployment strategy"
```

## **Stage 5: Project Structure & Standards**

```
/build --persona-architect --persona-scribe=en --c7 --plan
"Define project structure including: directory organization, coding standards, git workflow, documentation requirements, testing strategy, and quality gates"
```

## **Stage 6: Feature Specification**

```
/document --persona-scribe=en --persona-frontend --c7 --scope project
"Create comprehensive feature specifications for: user authentication, content creation/editing, blog post management, commenting system, search functionality, responsive design, and admin dashboard"
```

## **Stage 7: Infrastructure Planning**

```
/task infrastructure --persona-devops --seq --validate --safe-mode
"Plan infrastructure including: hosting strategy, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring setup, backup strategy, security considerations, performance optimization, and scaling approach"
```

## **Stage 8: Security & Performance Strategy**

```
/analyze --focus security --focus performance --persona-security --persona-performance --ultrathink --seq
"Analyze security requirements and performance targets including: authentication security, data protection, GDPR compliance, performance budgets, SEO optimization, and accessibility standards"
```

## **Stage 9: Testing Strategy**

```
/test --persona-qa --play --seq --validate
"Design comprehensive testing strategy including: unit testing approach, integration testing, E2E testing scenarios, performance testing, security testing, and accessibility testing"
```

## **Stage 10: Implementation Roadmap**

```
/task roadmap --wave-mode progressive --persona-architect --seq --validate
"Create detailed implementation roadmap with: phase definitions, deliverable specifications, quality checkpoints, risk assessment, and success criteria for each stage"
```

## **Command Execution Strategy**

### **Execution Order & Dependencies**

1. **Sequential Execution**: Run commands 1-3 first (foundation)
2. **Parallel Phase**: Commands 4-6 can run concurrently
3. **Integration Phase**: Commands 7-9 require previous outputs
4. **Finalization**: Command 10 synthesizes all planning

### **Expected Framework Auto-Activations**

- **Wave Mode**: Will auto-activate on commands 2, 7, 10 due to complexity
- **MCP Servers**: Context7 for documentation, Sequential for analysis
- **Token Efficiency**: --uc mode may activate for large outputs
- **Quality Gates**: All 8 validation steps will apply

### **Success Criteria Per Stage**

- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Evidence-based decisions with supporting data
- Comprehensive documentation
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Realistic timelines with buffer allocation

This approach leverages your framework's intelligent routing, persona specialization, and wave orchestration to ensure comprehensive planning with quality validation at each stage.
