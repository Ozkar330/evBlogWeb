### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

**Technical Risk Mitigation**:

- **Early Prototyping**: Build core features in Phase 1 to validate approach
- **Incremental Testing**: Test integrations as they're built
- **Fallback Options**: Identify alternatives for high-risk components
- **Documentation**: Maintain decision log and architectural documentation

**Schedule Risk Mitigation**:

- **Buffer Allocation**: 20% buffer in each phase for unknowns
- **Parallel Development**: Identify features that can be built simultaneously
- **MVP Approach**: Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Regular Checkpoints**: Weekly milestone reviews

**Quality Risk Mitigation**:

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside features
- **Code Reviews**: Self-review using best practices
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement early, monitor throughout
- **Security Best Practices**: Follow OWASP guidelines from start

### **Contingency Planning**

**If 2+ weeks behind schedule**:

1. **Scope Reduction**: Remove advanced search filters, defer analytics
2. **Feature Simplification**: Basic comment system, simplified admin
3. **Quality Trade-offs**: Reduce test coverage to 70%, defer accessibility

**If critical technical blockers emerge**:

1. **Rich Text Editor**: Fall back to markdown editor with preview
2. **Authentication**: Use simpler email/password only initially
3. **Search**: Implement basic text matching before full-text search
4. **Performance**: Accept slower initial performance, optimize later

### **Success Probability Assessment**

- **On-Time Delivery**: 75% probability with current buffers
- **Feature Complete**: 85% probability for MVP features
- **Quality Standards**: 80% probability meeting all acceptance criteria
- **Overall Success**: 70% probability delivering production-ready application
